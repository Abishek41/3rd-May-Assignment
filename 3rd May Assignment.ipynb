    "3. What is DBSCAN and how does it work for clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm in which groups point in a dataset based on density. The algorithm works by defining a neighbourhood around each point and finding dense regions of points. These dense regions are then grouped to form clusters, while the points not part of any dense region are considered noise."

    "\n",
    "Ans: The epsilon parameter in DBSCAN controls the neighbourhood size around each data point. A smaller epsilon will result in tighter data clustering and may identify smaller clusters as anomalies. A larger epsilon will result in looser data clustering and may not identify minor, isolated anomalies."

    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "Core points, border points, or noise points are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Core points: A data point is considered a core point if it has at least min_samples of other points within a distance of epsilon. Core points are dense and located at the core of a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Border points: A data point is considered a border point if it is within the epsilon neighbourhood of a core point but has less than min_samples neighbours within the epsilon radius. Border points are less dense than core points and are located at the edges of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise points: A data point is considered a noise point if it is not a core or border point. Noise points are isolated points that do not belong to any cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise points are often considered potential anomalies because they are isolated and do not fit into any cluster. Border points may also be considered anomalies if they are far from their nearest core point or have few neighbours. Core points are less likely to be anomalies as other points in the cluster surround them."

    "6. How does DBSCAN detect anomalies and what are the key parameters involved in the process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: DBSCAN can detect anomalies by labelling data points as noise or outliers, which are not part of any cluster. This is done by setting the minimum number of points required to form a cluster (min_samples) and a distance threshold (epsilon). Points that are not part of any cluster are considered anomalies. The effectiveness of anomaly detection with DBSCAN depends on tuning these parameters to the characteristics of the data."

    "\n",
    "Ans: The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm detects local outliers by computing a score based on the density of a point relative to its k nearest neighbours. The score is computed as the ratio of a point's average local reachability density and the average local reachability density of its k nearest neighbours. "

    "10. How can global outliers be detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Global outliers can be detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm by constructing isolation trees to isolate the data points. Each data point is assigned a score in this algorithm based on the number of splits required to isolate it from other points. The score is then used to determine whether the point is an outlier. Points with a lower score are considered to be outliers."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Local outlier detection is more appropriate when the data is distributed heterogeneously, and the anomalies are expected to be clustered in certain regions. Global outlier detection is more appropriate when the anomalies are uniformly distributed throughout the data, and there is no prior knowledge of their spatial distribution."
